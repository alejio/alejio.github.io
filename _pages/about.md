Hi, I'm Alex - welcome to my modest corner of the web!

An applied scientist by education, I nowadays see myself as a Data Science generalist who really enjoys improving the way things work. Particularly when that involves Python, Machine Learning and Statistics. Currently I live in London and spend most of my days planning and building ML-powered financial technology products at TrueLayer.

The motivation for (finally) starting a journal is that when life moves as fast as it does, it is quite valuable to take a step back and reflect a bit deeper on the things we find interesting. Expect to mostly see Data Science-related musings here - but not exclusively.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexspanos/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexiospanos).

Thank you for the visit!
