title: From Geophysics to "Data Scientist" 
categories: [Data Science, Career]

The unavoidable downfall of the Oil & Gas sector has made many highly skilled and capable Geophysicists look for a career change. As a former "visitor" of this industry, I would like to offer some perspective as to what it takes to pivot careers into "Data Science".

## My short career as a Geophysicist

As an MSc Statistics student at the University of Leeds back in 2012, I was offered an opportunity to do a internship, as part of my dissertation. At a real, global company based in the UK! And I would get a salary!!

The company that would host me was one of the big players in "Oil & Gas services" doing "marine seismic data acquisition and imaging". That meant little to me at the time, but it turns out that the company operated a sizable fleet of ships recording subsurface data, which would be processed onshore to create 3D images of the subsurface. Oil & Gas companies bought these 3D volumes (biiig data in tape format) which would in turn be interpreted by their scientists who would pinpoint high probability locations for extractable Oil & Gas reserves. (I apologise to the specialists for oversimplifying!)

My internship was research-focussed and explored ways that Machine Learning can automate legacy, manual workflows in Data Processing. I had lots of fun there during those 3 months, and learned a great deal from really smart people. I internalised profoundly how ML can make a REAL difference in industries stuck in their own ways, and had so many follow-up ideas!

At the end of my internship the company gave me my first *real* job offer, which I elatedly accepted - and began preparing my first ever conference talk based on my research. It didn't really matter to me at the time that the role offered was as a Geophysicist; I had enjoyed my experience immensely and was willing to give it a chance. Of course, I still didn't understand much about Geophysics!

I am grateful that over the next couple of years I learned a bunch of things about this niche and closed industry, and the role of the Geophysicist. However, the whole fossil fuels thing was not right for me (and the ecosystem) so I quit in order to continue on my original path, of the Data Scientist.

Making that pivot back to Data Scientist back in 2015 was the **hardest** thing I have ever done, professionally. Coming from this niche industry, I had to learn to convey succinctly to recruiters, hiring managers and interviewers what on earth I had been working on for the past couple of years - and convince them it was indeed relevant to the Data Scientist position I had applied to.

## The picture today

Geophysicists are finding themselves at a crossroads after the collapse of job supply in the Oil & Gas industry and many have chosen to pivot careers - very frequently to Data Science.

Since 2015 employer demand for "Data Scientist" roles increased, but the supply, especially for entry-level positions skyrocketed. Today, Data Scientists are well in the mainstream and can be found working across a wide variety of industries in the UK, but it remains to be seen how profound the impact of Covid on "fragile" and occasionally "luxury" positions will be in the economy.

This situation paints an intimidating picture for Geophysicists pivoting into "Data Science". But having run a few hiring processes in the past couple of years though, I strongly believe that the game does remain well open for pivoting candidates to creatively differentiate themselves from the competition and make a strong impression during the application stage.

With this post I want to achieve 2 goals:

1. Raise awareness to employers/recruiters that Geophysicists are truly multidisciplinary beasts that can be **EXCELLENT** hires for Data Science roles
2. Help Geophysicists identify their transferrable skills and areas for further specialisation to consider when applying to Data Science vacancies

**!Disclaimer!**: My perspective draws from my experience working in "Time Processing" (basically data preprocessing). In the industry it is considered the less illustrious sibling of "Depth Imaging" (basically application of geophysical models for imaging the preprocessed data). So apologies if the stuff below is a bit biased towards the Time Processing skillsets. 

And now a mini-rant I can't resist. This reminded me of how baffling and elitist I perceived the separation of the Time and Depth duties. A tech analogy is that Time Geos did the grunt work of data cleaning and initial feature engineering, and handed over the data for modelling to Depth geos. No, not quite like Data Engineers and Data Scientists (Data Scientists adore Data Engineers). This waterfall-y siloing of responsibilities created friction in business processes, lack of understanding, communication and common goals between teams thanks to a throw-over-the-wall mentality, and an avoidable unspoken hierarchy imposed amongst Geophysicists. A complete anti-pattern that modern tech companies strive to avoid!
