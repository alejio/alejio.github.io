title: Hiring Machine Learning Engineers Part 2 - Hiring process
categories: [Data Science]

[Part 1](https://alexiospanos.com/hiring-machine-learning-engineers-part-1/) discussed the emergence of the Machine Learning Engineer role, its distinction from the Data Scientist and the importance of organisations prioritising hiring the former against the latter when data infrastructure maturity is low. 

In Part 2, we will cover more practical considerations around the hiring process.



## 1. Get the job spec right

Amongst Data Scientist hype wave symptoms are job specs, where required skills are an incoherent mess of random buzzwords:

- "comfortable with Big Data technologies such as Hadoop"
- A bunch of way too specific statistical/Machine Learning techniques the poster has heard of (e.g. "k-means clustering")
- BI/Analytics stuff (Tableau usually) 
- A/B testing (always manages to sneak in somehow)

These job specs can be a major turn-off for anyone who has experience in the field; a clear tell that the business have no idea why they need such a hire. 

Regarding Machine Learning Engineer specs in the wild, I confess to not having too much experience. 

My impression through some research though, is that there is a tendency to overstate required skills/aptitudes on the modelling side. 

In truth, Machine Learning Engineers operate across the stack and care about all those things that make modelling possible. These include:

- Setting up data pipelines and setting up the storage layers;
- designing APIs;
- orchestrating microservices;
- monitoring performance (operational and predictive);
- managing deployments in the various production environments;
- contributing to different engineering libraries, which can be written in a non "ML-native" programming language;
- spending 20% of their time finding and fixing bugs.

There is so much going on for a Machine Learning Engineer to worry about, so when I see a relevant job spec that mentions Kaggle competitions and implementing arxiv NLP papers, I become sceptical. 

My general opinion for most roles, is that overly specific requirements do not benefit the hiring process.

It is a much better bet to describe in a bit more detail the actual responsibilities of the role rather than bloat the required experience and skills with redundant jargon. In a relevant tangent, I would strongly question the practical value of asking for specific academic qualifications. Does someone actually need a PhD to be a Machine Learning Engineer? In most cases it sounds like more of a cultural (or even vanity) requirement rather than a technical one.

## 2. Getting the task right

I like take home assignments. Done right, they provide value to both sides of the process regardless of the outcome.

In my experience as a Data Scientist, the hiring process of most companies include an assignment; I've repeatedly seen how important a good submission is for a candidate. 

Now, having been through the process of evaluating Machine Learning Engineer tasks for candidates, I retrospectively realise the caveats [...] 



(realistic)

## 3. Interviewing



## 4. Having realistic expectations

(never get person you want)
