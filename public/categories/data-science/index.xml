    <description><![CDATA[<p>Many highly skilled Geophysicists are currently considering a career change to &ldquo;Data Science&rdquo;. Leaning on my brief time as a Data Processing Geophysicist, I would like to shed some light on the commonalities and dissimilarities of this role with Data Science.</p>
<h2 id="the-picture-today">The picture today</h2>
<p>The volatility and general collapse of the price of oil has caused big ripples down the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Many Geophysicists are now considering more seriously than ever the prospect of pivoting careers - and one of the most popular routes seems to be Data Science.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://alexiospanos.com/hiring-machine-learning-engineers-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Part 1</a> discussed the emergence of the Machine Learning Engineer role, its distinction from the Data Scientist and the importance of organisations prioritising hiring the former against the latter when data infrastructure maturity is low. In Part 2, we will cover more practical considerations around the hiring process.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, my team decided to hire for a <em>Machine Learning Engineer</em>. Whilst considering the requirements for this role, a relatively new and ill-defined one in the industry, I found myself thinking about its contrast with the <em>Data Scientist</em> - incidentally, the role I continue to identify mostly with.</p>
<p>In the recent past this kind of distinction only made academic sense to me. I will confess to subconsciously thinking that a Machine Learning Engineer is someone who took the <a href="https://www.fast.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">fast.ai</a> course and now builds Deep Learning models on GPU&rsquo;s, claiming out-of-the-world performances, without considering caveats and biases of the underlying datasets.</p>]]></description>
