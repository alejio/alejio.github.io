      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-leadership-playbooks-or-operating-principles&#34;&gt;Data leadership playbooks or operating principles?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Embarking on a Head of Data role without previous leadership and people management experience was a challenge interesting enough. Having made a bunch of mistakes and another bunch of good calls, I think it is a good time to write about the experience in the hope that I will have learned something through reflection. Also taking this leap of courage to publish, as some people may who have already been on a similar journey, or are preparing to embark on one might find it a useful input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
