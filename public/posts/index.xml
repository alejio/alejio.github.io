    <description><![CDATA[Many highly skilled Geophysicists are currently considering a career change to &ldquo;Data Science&rdquo;. Leaning on my brief time as a Data Processing Geophysicist, I would like to shed some light on the commonalities and dissimilarities of this role with Data Science.
The picture today The volatility and general collapse of the price of oil has caused big ripples down the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

    <description><![CDATA[Doubling up on my Data Scientist role, I did a stint as interim Product Manager for our product team. Here are my thoughts on Product Management and my observations on what it takes to succeed in high uncertainty environments (aka startups). And the million dollar question: how to hire a good Product Manager?
A Data Scientist&rsquo;s roundtrip to Product Management Startup life can be quite unpredictable. I hadn&rsquo;t imagined when I joined as a &ldquo;Data Scientist&rdquo; 1.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Part 1 discussed the emergence of the Machine Learning Engineer role, its distinction from the Data Scientist and the importance of organisations prioritising hiring the former against the latter when data infrastructure maturity is low. In Part 2, we will cover more practical considerations around the hiring process.
Get the job spec right If you&rsquo;ve spent a bit of time looking at Data Scientist job listings, you&rsquo;ll have certainly encountered specs containing an incoherent mess of random buzzwords:]]></description>

In the recent past this kind of distinction only made academic sense to me. I will confess to subconsciously thinking that a Machine Learning Engineer is someone who took the fast.]]></description>
