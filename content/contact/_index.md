I'm always interested in conversations about building data capabilities in startups, mentoring data leaders, or navigating the challenges of ML in production. If you're working on similar problems or just want to exchange ideas, reach out.

Open to advisory roles, mentoring, and speaking opportunities at conferences or panels.
