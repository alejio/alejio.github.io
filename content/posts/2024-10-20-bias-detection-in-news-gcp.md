This is the first part of a series where I plan to develop an app to track bias in media publications in Greece.


## Motivation

As a teenage football fan in Greece, I quickly became disillusioned with the sports media landscape. Journalists would constantly emphasise the referee's influence on matches. After matches, I would frequently encounter highly diverging opinions on match events, that a neutral observer would find pretty unequivocal. The opinion pieces became entirely predictable, and bereft of "signal". I eventually gave up on Greek football altogether - it was only football after all..  

Anyway, years later as a Data Scientist in the UK I was witnessing the explosion in the field of NLP, and the birth of amazing projects such as Factmata. 

But NLP projects in Greece? Crickets..

Things seems to be changing fast in 2024 though. [Meltemi](https://www.ilsp.gr/en/news/meltemi-en/) became the first Greek LLM, and new projects using AI for summarisation of political discourse such as [OpenCouncil](www.opencouncil.gr) and [this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kperifanos_videoanalytics-ai-activity-7244629664386699265-xvNh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) have dropped.


Perhaps there would be ways to help people in Greece have more context about the track record of media sources on specific topics.
B
 is a pretty interesting time to explore this subject. NLP has lagged be
A few months ago the first Greek LLM arrived


The Data Scientist in me would love to see some metrics around bias over time across different news outlets.


in the back of my mind, I've always wished that there was a way to provide context to readers that what they are reading is 
Since opinion pieces think that prompting a fine-tuned LLM could faithfully predict a journalist's match report.
