Hey there, I'm Alex.

I specialise in Data Science, using it to empower organizations in crafting better products and services. Lately, my focus has shifted towards building and leading teams; currently I head up the Data function of a Fintech start-up in the Open Banking space.

Having worked in Open Banking since 2018 and shipped Data Science products to 6 countries, it is an area I've built significant expertise in.

I reside in London and love being part of the city's vibrant tech community! I'm particularly passionate about discussing innovative applications of Data, ML, and AI, and how they can address our most pressing challenges and aspirations.
