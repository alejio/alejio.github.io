**Hey there, I'm Alex, a data and AI leader with a track record of building data capabilities that drive tangible business impact.**

I specialise in **AI, machine learning, and data platform architecture**. I'm currently **Head of Data at Stream**. Previously, I was **Head of Data & AI at Lunos**, where I led data and AI efforts as part of the founding team.

I write about data leadership, AI strategy, and building data capabilities in high-growth environments.

## My journey

My career is grounded in a strong foundation in **Data Science**. I hold an MSc in Statistics (awarded with distinction) and have been a **Chartered Statistician (CStat)** for over a decade. From there, I applied machine learning in various domains: starting with geophysics, where I developed ML approaches that reduced seismic data QC time by 70%; and later in financial services, open banking, and fintech.

Since 2018, I’ve worked at the forefront of **Open Banking and fintech AI**, being the first data hire at companies like **TrueLayer** (the UK’s first open banking unicorn) and **Tarabut** (MENA’s leading open banking platform). Across these roles, I built data teams, delivered data products deployed across six regions, and generated multi-million dollar revenue from data initiatives - always with a pragmatic, impact-driven approach to AI and data science.

## Highlights

- **AI & Machine Learning Leadership**: Delivered production-grade ML systems in fintech: from financial behaviour insights to automated categorisation and verification services. Led MLOps efforts ensuring 99.9% availability and weekly model updates at scale.
- **Data Platforms & Governance**: Designed and integrated cloud-native data platforms (AWS, GCP, Snowflake, dbt). Chaired data governance committees, embedding compliance with data protection laws through policies, processes, and culture change.
- **Open Banking & Fintech Data Products**: Built data capabilities and products that opened new revenue streams, contributing over **$4M in data product revenue** and serving internal and external stakeholders across regions.
- **Team Building & Technical Leadership**: Scaled data functions across 4+ countries, managing 10+ FTE, and reporting directly to CEOs and CTOs.

## Certifications & Affiliations

- **Chartered Statistician (CStat)** — Royal Statistical Society  
- **Advanced Data Science Professional (AfDSP)** — Alliance for Data Science Professionals  
- **Certified ML Engineer (AWS)**  
- **Professional Data Engineer (Google Cloud)**  

## Speaking & Publications

I’ve presented on ML/MLOps and open banking data products at industry conferences, and co-authored peer-reviewed research in applied ML and statistics.
